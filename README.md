# ZIp_Unzip
Basically is a Java and C# Code for Backing Up a bulky directory from a desired path, to zip it to an another path of choice.
Also, it deletes the files that have been zipped.
And also does it checks the directory where you have saved the zipfile, for file older than 7 days and delete them
Just don't forget to modify the srcPath(directory to be zpped) and the Targetpath(directory where zip and logs file is to be created) in the code before use.
Will Soon update a soft approach for this.
